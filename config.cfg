[Benchmarks to run]
# Define benchmarks in the following format:
# run_id, prompt_type, model_path, lora_path, quantization, n_iterations

# Details:
# - run_id: A string to identify the benchmark run
# - prompt_type: The prompt format (e.g., openai_api, chatml, etc.)
# - model_path: Huggingface model ID, local path, or OpenAI model name
# - lora_path: Path to local lora adapter (optional)
# - quantization: Using bitsandbytes package (8bit, 4bit, None)
# - n_iterations: Number of benchmark iterations (final score will be an average)

# Examples:
# myrun1, qwen, Qwen/Qwen-14B-Chat, /path/to/local/lora/adapter, 8bit, 3
# myrun2, openai_api, gpt-4-0613, , , 1
