However, he could also feel confident in his abilities since he believes that art criticism is not for the faint-hearted.

However, Ace repeatedly undermines him and challenges his abilities. This could make Ben feel humiliated as he's not able to make a strong impact on Ace. He might also feel angry at Ace's disregard for the consequences of their actions and the danger they pose to others. Ben might feel proud of his detective skills, but it's not a strong emotion in this context.
