There is a hint of triumph when she ends the conversation by excusing herself, but it's not her primary emotion. She doesn't appear to be confused by Barty's intentions or the value he assigns to the armoire; she simply doesn't share his perspective.\n\nRevised scores:\nBored: 3\nCondescending: 8\nTriumphant: 1\nConfused: 1", "37": "First pass scores:\nJoy: 0\nShame: 0\nRejection: 9\nTriumph: 0\n\nCritique:\nDeirdre is likely feeling a strong sense of rejection due to Scott's decision to leave and pursue his own dreams.
